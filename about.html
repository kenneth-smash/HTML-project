   <p>This is my about page. There are an abundance of things that I like to do.
       One thing that I like to do is to watch YouTube videos, play basketball,chess, and learn new things about the life in general.
    </p> 
    
    <p> Another fasanating thing is that when I go off to college, I want to attend U of M Ann Arbor. Then go off to grad school with a scholarship at U of M or move to Harvard University. Afterwards I'm going to a Medical School that is top tier, but doesn't have to be the best school. </p>
